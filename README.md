## Instructions

A simple recreation of a classic arcade game loved by many!

To get started, open [the GitHub pages site for this repo](https://thedelk.github.io/fend-project-3/) and try to make it across the street!

## Dependencies

This project is pretty simple, and most of the code was provided by Udacity, so there aren't any external dependencies!

## History

The project skeleton was provided with older ES5 prototype syntax, so I updated it to reflect ES6's new class syntactic sugar.

The idea was to get the base functionality working, and then explore utilizing one of the several dozen Javascript game engines out there to make the game much more fun and exciting.

Alas, I got ahead of myself and, despite spending literally dozens of hours exploring, picking, choosing, testing, deliberating, and troubleshooting, I was unable to achieve my goal of utilizing those other libraries.

I plan on revisiting this in the future once I have some more experience under my belt, so for now, the bare bones minimum will have to suffice!

## Rubric

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
